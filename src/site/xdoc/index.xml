<section name="Commons Imaging: a Pure-Java Image Library">

<subsection name="Introduction">

<p>
  Apache Commons Imaging, previously known as Apache Commons Sanselan, is a library that
  reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing
  of image info (size, color space, ICC profile, etc.) and metadata.
</p>
<p>
  This library is pure Java. It's slower, consequently, but perfectly portable.
  It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports
  more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.
</p>
<p>
  Imaging was working and was used by a number of projects in production even before version 1.0.
</p>
<p>
  This project is Open Source; free as in freedom and free as in beer.
  It is available under the ASF (Apache) License. This is a non-viral Open Source license.
